# Rust Notes

This repository contains notes taken from reading Rust source code and
documentation. These notes are divided into categories based on the different
projects or components that I was spending time reviewing and learning more
about.

For me, reading existing source code is a helpful way to learn more about a
new language. The notes in this repository were taken while reading official
documentation, and source code.
